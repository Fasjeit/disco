			<strong>libdisco</strong> is based on the <a href="/disco.html">Strobe protocol framework</a> and on <a href="https://cr.yp.to/ecdh/curve25519-20060209.pdf">Curve25519</a>. What this means to you is that the library supports a diverse range of symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic.
		</p>
		<p>
			The different symmetric cryptography operations available are documented in the <i class="fa fa-bars" aria-hidden="true"></i>  menu on the left.
		</p>
		<p>
			The asymmetric operations are available through Golang's standard cryptographic library.
